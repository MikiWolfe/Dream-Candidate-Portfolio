# Dream-Candidate-Portfolio

## Portfolio of the new potential employee

We are trying to build a portfolio for an employee who is applying for a job at their dream company. They would be great in this position and we are trying to showcase their work and achievements. 

There is a sample portfolio provided and we are attempting  to match our project as closely as possible.

We are using flex-box as much as possible for the lay out for this project. Unlike the last project we are embracing < div > .

Comments are clearly defining sections of HTML and CSS code so others can follow the path of how the code was organized. 

Things I learned from this project:

    -Anything can be put a < div > but importaint to put things in semantic tags when appropriate. 
    -It's fine to start a project, realize that it's not doing the way you want it to and start over, but keep the base as a skeleton. 
    - How to put text tags onto images using CSS.
