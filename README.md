# Dream-Candidate-Portfolio

## Portfolio of the new potential employee

We are trying to build a portfolio for an employee who is applying for a job at their dream company. They would be great in this position and we are trying to showcase their work and achievements. 

There is a sample portfolio provided and we are attempting to match our project as closely as possible. 
We are using flexbox as to keep the website mobile and tablet friendly by making it responsive. 

We are using flex-box as much as possible for the lay out for this project. Unlike the last project we are embracing < div > .

Comments are clearly defining sections of HTML and CSS code so others can follow the path of how the code was organized. 


### Things I learned from this project:

    -Anything can be put a < div > but importaint to put things in semantic tags when appropriate. 
    -It's fine to start a project, realize that it's not doing the way you want it to and start over, but keep the base as a skeleton. 
    -How to put text tags onto images using CSS. 
    -How importaint it is to do Git pushes when working on a project, not just adds and commits.  


One thing I really struggled with was keeping the website responsive when adding text over images.  I ended up putting footers on the bottom of the images because I was so unhappy with where the text would float off to when I changed my browser window or used chrome-developer to change the layout.
